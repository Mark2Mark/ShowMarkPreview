# ShowMarkPreview

*View > Show Mark Preview* is a [Glyphs.app](https://glyphsapp.com/) plug-in for previewing mark-to-base and mark-to-mark attachment directly in Edit view.

### Installation

Please install the plugin via the built-in Plugin Manager, available via *Window > Plugin Manager,* and restart the application.

### Usage Instructions

1. Activate *View > Show Mark Preview.*
2. Open an Edit tab with any number of letters and marks containing appropriate mark attachment anchors (e.g., `top` and `_top`, respectively).

The marks will be stacked onto all letters in the Edit tab.

### Known Problems

* Unfortunately, I cannot disable the default mark cloud under all circumstances (yet).
* Typing new sidebearings in the grey glyph info box (View > Show Glyph Info) does not work when *View > Show Mark Preview* is on, at least in 2.5b (1072).
